# Audio analysis


`TimeVectors.py` takes a BORIS file as input and produces a plot of *conversation consistency* and *conversation equity* over time, as defined by Archibeque [*et al.*](https://www.compadre.org/per/items/detail.cfm?ID=14566). These measures are useful for evaluating how speaking time is shared in small groups and how consistent the share of speaking time remains over time.
