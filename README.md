# Lab Analysis
The scripts and notebooks in this repository were used in various projects to analyze video, audio, and other products of students in introductpry physics labs at Cornell University.

`Audio-analysis` includes python functions for examining the consistency and equality of student speaking interactions in small groups. These scripts can be used in conjunction with exported data from [Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) software](http://www.boris.unito.it/).

`LabEpistemologySurvey-analysis` includes R and jupyter notebooks used to analyze a lab epistemology survey developed by [Hu *et al.*](https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.010121).

`Video-analysis` includes scripts and notebooks for analyzing student interactions in labs from whole-class video observations. Analyses can, again, be conducted using BORIS exported data. We also examined using computer vision tools (i.e., *OpenCV*) to automatically track student interactions from video.
